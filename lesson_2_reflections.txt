Git sets up all the initial items but does not commit. 
It also adds the .git hidden folder

The stagging area gives you a nice inbetween to control the content of 
a commit as well as review a commit before you complete it.

The stagging area gives you a chance to review the items you will commit. 
In turn you can verify all the files located inside
only relate to one logical change.

Branches can be really useful for diffrent versions. Say a project has Mac or windows version.
Or a release version then a beta version

The log isnt always a complete picture nor is it in a obvious order sometimes. 
Takeing the time to draw it all out helps you see the structure of the log in a
easier to understand fashion.

Useing the point where the code branched as refernce git makes educated choices as to what lines need
to stay and what lines need to be removed.It is viewed as merging one branch into another like merging
the code for a side project into the master branch.

Auto merging can save a lot of time for the most part with careful planning conflicts can be avoided.
on the negitive side though there is still a chance for it to merge code that breaks the code.
for example if a required line was removed.Or if two sets of code were done for the same function but in diffrent spots.
For example two functions so you could have two functions by the same name added.
